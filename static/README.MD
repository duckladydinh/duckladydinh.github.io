<h1>Hallo</h1>

This website is created as my personal blog which is an optional requirement of the LMU Elite Data Science program. I want to apply, so that's why I am making this. But honestly, I am not sure how much efforts can be invested here. Anyway, I consider it a personal challenge to learn about web technologies which I never really had an idea about what it was before.

<b>Will there be 1001 stories, or it is just a moment of fun? We will see.</b>

This is an automatically generated website by Parcel. Since the idiotic Github does not allow publishing from multiple sources, the real project cannot be put in master, but must be placed in a separate branch, namely 'dev'.
